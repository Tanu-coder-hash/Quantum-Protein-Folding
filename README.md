# Quantum-Protein-Folding
This project demonstrates a quantum-inspired protein folding algorithm for short sequences (5–10 amino acids) using a hybrid BCC+FCC lattice model. The goal is to predict protein folds by simulating residue interactions in 3D space, balancing biophysical realism with quantum encoding principles.
